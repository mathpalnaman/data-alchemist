### A Note on Dependencies and Security
1)
During installation, `npm audit` reports a known high-severity vulnerability (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6, GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9) in the `xlsx` package. Currently, no patched version from the maintainer is available.
For this assessment, the risk is considered negligible as the application will only process trusted, internally-provided data files.
In a live production environment, the recommended course of action would be to migrate to an alternative, actively patched library such as `exceljs` to mitigate any potential security risks from user-uploaded files.
